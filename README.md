Capstone overview:

This project attempts to let the user create a list of ingredients and an API call should return a list of recipes to chose from that have those ingredients.
Once the recipe is selected, it should get stored the users history.
Hopefully a graph is populated with the nutrients the user has used based on ingredients in their history.
